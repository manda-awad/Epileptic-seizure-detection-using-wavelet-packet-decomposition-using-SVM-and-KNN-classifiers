# Epileptic-seizure-detection-using-wavelet-packet-decomposition-using-SVM-and-KNN-classifiers

This project used Bonn University database which has only single channel. In this project, I would like to indicate that I built my feature extraction code based on (Detection of Epileptic Seizure Event and Onset Using EEG) research paper. In addition, I extracted multiple different meaningful features such as entropy, standard deviation, maximum, minimum and average:

The following decomposition tree figure explains how the wavelet coefficients were extracted using 4 decomposition levels and Daubechies 4 (db4) type of mother wavelet:
